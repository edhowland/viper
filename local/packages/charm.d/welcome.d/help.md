charm welcome is the command to change whether or not the Welcome message
will be displayed upon Viper startup when no files have been specified on the command line.


Without any subcommand supplied,  charm welcome will tell you whether or not
the Welcome banner will be displayed upon Viper startup.
Then it will actually display the banner for you.

## charm welcome remove

The remove subcommand will cause the  Welcome banner to be no longer displayed
upon Viper startup when there are no files to edit on the command line.

This behaviour can be restored by the charm welcome restore subcommand. See below

## charm welcome restore

The restore subcommand will restore the behaviour of Viper to display the Welcome
banner upon startup when there are no files to edit.
