Welcome to the Viper code/text editor and its embedded scripting language
charm is the  Viper ecosystem manager. You ran "charm start" which displays this banner.
The "start" subcommand of charm removes the  initial Welcome banner whenever Viper
starts with no files to edit.


Recommended next steps:

You might want to run:

charm config. This subcommand will initialize your ~/.vishrc and also create and
populate ~/.config/viper/ with configuration files and modifiable content such as
macros and key bindings.


You might also want to explore: charm status which will display which of these
settings have been accomplished. 

Also, charm ls will display known installed packages, modules and plugins.


You can get more help with charm help
which will display all available subcommands for charm.
