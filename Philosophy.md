# The philosophy of Viper

## Abstract

Every project has a philosophy, either explicit or implicit.
An objective, a goal and a way of doing things.
A reason for being, its zen if you please.

These are my thoughts, they may not be yours.
Grains of salt are not what they are cracked upt to be. Just ask Lot's wife.

## Opinioms



- Code should work  for good, not for ill.
  * Be enlightened here: [Ruby for good](https://rubyforgood.org/join-us)
- Discoverability is better than obscurity
  * Seek, and ye shall find
- Simple beats out complex every time
  * Simplect and complect are weaving terms referring to braids.
- Loose coupling should be preferred over deep coupling
  *  Enjoy [Lego and Philosophy. Constructing reality brick by brick](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/LEGO+and+Philosophy:+Constructing+Reality+Brick+By+Brick-p-9781119193975#maincontent)
- REPL oriented development beats interactive development (I.e. IDEs)
  * Strange that an author of a code editor would think that. 
  * But can your editor drop into its own REPL to change itself? Viper can and does: Read more [Vish.md](Vish.md)
- Use what you already know, not what  what you are force fed
  * Teach one to fish, and all that jazz
  * Viper is builtin on nomenclature from the venerable Unix directory and command names
- Lean syntax is superior to over-sugared syntax
  * "Syntax sugar gives you cancer of the semicolon", Alan Perliss, the first winner of the ACM Turing Award
- Taking the first step is way better than staying put
  * Learning Vish, already knowing Bash and other shells is a just a short from where you probably already are
  * In Vish variables are dereferenced witha ':' instead of a '$'
  * See, you are now an working Vish programmer. Wasn't that easy?
- Kindliness sure whips the pants off 
  * Jerks and ashholes stay off my grass
- Diversity in all its forms will surely overcome bigotry and all of his cousins
  * Many are called, but few are chosen
- Decisions deferred outlast corners into which I have painted myself
  * Avoiding the new bright shiny in favor of setting realistic goals that be accomplished sooner
- The Functional sports car will arrive at the checkered flag way before the imperative stationwagon
  * Not that my code is really more functional, originating in 2015, but Ruby allows multi-paradigm programming
  * But I must have prophesied some of that because Vish supports lambdas and higher order functions
- Composibility overcomes more  big up-front design
  *  The whole Lego mindset yet again!

## Conclusions

You do not have to share all or even most of the above Zen of Viper precepts
in order to work on this project to ease the lives of blind developers, but
if you do share some of them, you will make me a smiling happy fool. :)
