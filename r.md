# VIPER

## Visually Impaired Programmer's Editor in Ruby

### Version 1.1.1




## Abstract

This is a simple editor in Ruby that works with screen readers, esp. like VoiceOver 
in Mac OS/X. 
Viper only attempts an audible interface. Sighted users of the program will only see confusing gibberish on the screen.


## System requirements


Viper has been tested with Ubuntu 14.04, Ruby 2.2 and the terminal type: xterm-256color.
Some limited testing has been done on the Mac's OS/X Terminal.app. YMMV!
