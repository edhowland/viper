# Viper modes

## Abstract

A mode in Viper contains all the keybindings that are useful for that mode. E.g. in
delete mode, only a few keys are active like 'd', 'c', 'w', 'j', 'k' and 'l'

Viper operates in a single mode at any given time. Which mode is active depends on the
command or key press used in the current mode was used to activate it.

Viper starts up in viper mode which is the basic editor mode.
