# VIPER

## Text and Code editor for use with screen readers

### Version 2.0.0


## Abstract

This is a simple editor in Ruby that works with screen readers, esp. like VoiceOver 
in Mac OS/X, or with Orca in Linux with Gnome desktops.
Viper only attempts an audible interface. Sighted users of the program will only see confusing gibberish on the screen.


## System requirements



Viper requires Ruby versions:

- ruby 2.2.2p95
- ruby 2.3.1p112
- ruby 2.4.1p111

Or similar versions of Ruby.


## Contributing


Please see the file CONTRIBUTING.md for information on contributing to the Viper project. 
I am looking forward to your support and welcome any help. Together, we can make Viper a great project
for all visually impaired or blind programmers.  I am especially requesting help from programmers in other programming languages like Python, Golang, Javascript, etc.
