Running ruby test_repl_pda.rb
results in 2 errors according to no support, yet, for sdouble or single quotes.

If in state: :S0, and get a double quote
Move to state :S1 and push DQuote

Ignore all characters in state :S1 except another double quote, 
and look for the stack top to be DQuote
if it it is, then move to :S0, and pop the stack

Repeat this for single quote, but push (and wait for) SQuote instead

- DQuote => :S1
SQuote => :S2

## Refinements

- handle \", \' in respective states

:S1 \ => :S3
:S3 " => :S1

:S2 \ => :S4
:S4 ' => :S2

All other :S3, :S4 will revertback to :S1, :S2 respectively.
